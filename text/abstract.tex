This paper investigates the feasibility of a network access control solution which provides fine-grained access control in an OpenFlow software defined networking environment. Using the Faucet SDN controller a solution is developed which provides the dynamic allocation of both VLANs and ACLs to produce an access control solution for deploying user-specific access restrictions, allowing for consistent network access as clients move around the network. The EAPoL protocol is used for authentication, providing all major EAP methods for authentication and mac authentication bypass functionality for devices unable to connect to tradition secure environments.
