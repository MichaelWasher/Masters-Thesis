I would like to thank my parents, Michelle and Alan for their continual support throughout my academic journey. I would also like to thank my brother and sister, Jonathan and Sarah-Michelle. I have always been able to look up to you and find quality role-models.\\\\
I would also like to thank the WAND team at The University of Waikato, especially Brad Cowie and Dr. Richard Nelson for assisting me throughout my research and providing me the resources, information and inspiration to write this paper.\\\\
