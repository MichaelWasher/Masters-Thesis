\chapter{Conclusion}
This paper has investigated the feasibility of producing a network access control system for a Faucet-driven software defined network.
It has presented a system for providing network authentication and control and has successfully achieved the initial investigation goals.
The provided solution supports the deployment of fine-grained network access control without the requiring unreasonable maintenance overhead.
The solution also provides a mechanism for authenticating devices typically unable to authenticate to secure networks through the use of  mac authentication bypass by performing authentication on behalf of devices that are unable to connect to secure networks using EAP methods.
